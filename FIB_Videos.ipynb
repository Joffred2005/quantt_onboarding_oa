    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "1. Git is a distributed version control system (VCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Git is decentralized, meaning every developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### GitHub Operations\n",
    "21. To add a remote repository: git remote add origin [URL]\n",
    "\n",
    "22. First push to remote requires: git push -u origin main\n",
    "\n",
    "23. After initial push, simply use: git push\n",
    "\n",
    "24. To prevent files from being pushed, create a gitignore file.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. A pull request is a request to merge changes into the main code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Commands\n",
    "26. Generate SSH keys with: ssh keygen\n",
    "\n",
    "27. To add and commit in one command: git commit && git add -m \"message\"\n",

    "## Fill-in-the-Blank Questions: Financial Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following statements with the key terms and concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "1. A derivative is a contract based on something underlying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A derivative is at its essence a very simple concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Turkey Example\n",
    "3. Terry McLoud needs to buy 20 turkeys every year at Thanksgiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Terry pre-arranges delivery from Bailey's farms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Terry and Mr. Bailey agree on a price of $15 per turkey.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Mr. Bailey provides an IOU for 20 turkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This contract is derived from the underlying turkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Types of Derivatives\n",
    "8. The first type is a forward or future, which involves delivery in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The second type is an option, which gives the buyer the option to buy or sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The third type is a swap, which exchanges a floating rate for a fixed rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options\n",
    "11. Terry pays $50 to Mr. Jones for the right to buy 20 turkeys at $15.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. This option acts as a hedge in case Mr. Bailey's farm fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. If Terry doesn't exercise the option by the 23 of November, it expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swaps\n",
    "14. A swap allows you to exchange a floating rate for a fixed rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. The swap is based on an underlying instrument, typically a bond or loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underlying Instruments\n",
    "16. The underlying in Terry's case is turkeys, which are a commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. interest rates are one of the biggest underlyings in derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Other underlyings include credit (credit derivatives), foreign exchange, and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trading Derivatives\n",
    "19. Derivatives can be traded on an exchange or over the counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. In an exchange, prices are listed and visible to traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. In an over-the-counter market, it's an agreement between two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Most people trading derivatives are interested in the contract, not the underlying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contract Values\n",
    "23. If turkey prices are low, Terry might only get $150 for his contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. If there's a turkey shortage, Terry might sell his contract for $400.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Contract value changes based on supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks\n",
    "26. The first risk is leverage, which means using borrowed money.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. With leverage, if the contract price goes down, you can lose all of your principal very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. The second risk is counterpart risk, the risk that the other party won't fulfill their obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Mr. Bailey is a counterparty risk because he might not deliver the turkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. If Mr. Bailey's farm goes under and Terry has no option, he'll need a Thanksgiving drink."
